<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Sam has prepared a fitness program so that he can become more strong! 
	The program is made of N sessions. During the i-th session, Sam will 
	do certain amount of pushups. The number of pushups he does in each 
	session are strictly increasing.
</p>
<p>
	The <i>difficulty</i> of his fitness program is equal to the maximum 
	difference in the number of pushups between any two consecutive training 
	sessions.
</p>
<p>
	To make his program less difficult, Sam has decided to add up to K 
	additional training sessions to his fitness program. He can add these 
	sessions anywhere in his fitness program, and do any number of pushups 
	in each of them. After the additional training session are added, 
	the number of pushups he does in each session must still be strictly increasing. 
	What is the minimum difficulty possible?

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> 
	<p>
		Two arguments
		<ul>
			<li>
			first - list of positive integers. The number of pushups in
			each training session;
			</li>
			<li>
			second - positive integer. Additional sessions that Sam may 
			add to his fitness program.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>
	<p>	
		An integer. The minimum difficulty possible after up to K additional 
		training sessions are added.

<!-- Give some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">
workout([100, 200, 230], 1) == 50
workout([10, 13, 15, 16, 17], 2) == 2
</pre>
	<p>
	In the first case Sam can add up to one session. The added sessions 
	are marked in bold: 100, <strong>150</strong>, 200, 230. The difficulty is now 50.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the second case Sam can add up to two sessions. Then his optimal fitness program
	may be as foloows: 10, <strong>11</strong>, 13, 15, 16, 17, <strong>18</strong>. 
	The difficulty is now 2
